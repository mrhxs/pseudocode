Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
ADD first number and second number together and store the result in total
RETURN total

INIT total to 0
INPUT a number
WHILE the number is not 0
  ADD number to total
  INPUT a number
END WHILE
RETURN total

Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Programmers use pseudocode to convey concepts wihout using a specific language or syntax. It's a general way to get across
a concept without being language specific.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A computer would not be able to run an pseudocode. It's not an actual programming language a computer can use. 

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
    PRINT first number
IF first number is less than second number THEN
    PRINT second number
END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT c to 1
WHILE c is less than or equal to 100
PRINT c
add 1 to c
END WHILE

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT pbSearch to user search
FOR all phonebook entries loop through
IF pbSearch equals phonebook entry
    RETURN entry
END IF
END FOR
IF pbSearch does equal value of the indexed location
    PRINT No Results Found
END IF

var findEntry = prompt("Enter Phonebook Search Here"); // This will be a user input from a dialog box

// phoneBook Example JavaScript
let phoneBook = {
    '1': {
       name: 'Mike',
       phoneNumber: '330-242-2700',
       address: '50 Waverly rd',
       city: 'Fayetteville',
       state: 'AR'
     },
    '2': {
        name: 'Kelsey',
        phoneNumber: '215-123-6600',
        address: '48 Canterburry dr',
        city: 'Cleveland',
        state: 'OH'
     }  
   };
   
   let pbSearch = "Kelsey";
   let x = 0;
   
   for (var i = 0; i < Object.keys(phoneBook).length; i++) {
     if (pbSearch == phoneBook[Object.keys(phoneBook)[i]].name) {
       console.log(phoneBook[Object.keys(phoneBook)[i]]);
       x += 1;
       reutrn;
       }
     };
   if (x == 0) {
     console.log('No results Found');
   };
