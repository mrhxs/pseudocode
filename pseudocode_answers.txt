Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
ADD first number and second number together and store the result in total
RETURN total

INIT total to 0
INPUT a number
WHILE the number is not 0
  ADD number to total
  INPUT a number
END WHILE
RETURN total

Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Programmers use pseudocode to convey concepts wihout using a specific language or syntax. It's a general way to get across
a concept without being language specific.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A computer would not be able to run an pseudocode. It's not an actual programming language a computer can use. 

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
    PRINT first number
IF first number is less than second number THEN
    PRINT second number
END IF

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT c to 100
WHILE c is less than or equal to 100
PRINT c
END WHILE

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT find to user searche
IF find does not equal phonebook index
    add 1 to phonebook index
IF find does equal phonebook index
    PRINT find
END IF

var findEntry = prompt("Enter Phonebook Search Here"); // This will be a user input from a dialog box

// assuming there is an array of Phonebook Entries
function searchPhonebook(var) {
    for (i = 0; i <= phonebook.length; i++)
     if (var === phonebook[i]) {
         return phonebook[i];
     } else {
         return console.log("Entry can't be found");
     }
};
